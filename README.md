Project 2 that I made for Mashups
==================================

As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are accessible to us via public web APIsâ€”Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. 

How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? 
Taking a hands-on approach, much of class time will be spent creating projects and writing code, primarily JavaScript, for client-side (front-end) web development.
